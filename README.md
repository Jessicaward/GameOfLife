# Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life is a state-determined game devised by the British Mathematician John Conway in 1970.

Each cell on the board has two states, alive and dead.

The rules of the game are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies due to underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives.
3. Any live cell with more than three neighbours dies due to overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours is born, due to reproduction.
